Hello  # EEK
Here i would talk about myself. Maybe it could be interesting for somebody. 
I'm from the north  edge of earth. I've lived here for 17 years, and, of course, it affected on my mindset and my behavior (f. ex i always wear underpants)
Moreover i have a parents. This is two big rocks of my own "island of unconscious". 
I'm doomed to be influenced by these two factors: my teachers and the place where i grew up.
